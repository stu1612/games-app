/**
 * HydratedGamesPage â€” Server Component
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Prefetches and hydrates game data on the server before rendering a client component.
 * - Uses TanStack React Query to fetch game data based on a dynamic slug (e.g., 'popular-2024').
 * - Wraps the client-side `GamesGrid` component in a <HydrationBoundary> to enable seamless hydration.
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. Receives props:
 *    - `slug`: dynamic route parameter (e.g., 'popular-2024', 'best-of-the-year')
 *    - `url`: fully constructed RAWG API URL for fetching game data
 *
 * 2. Uses a new `QueryClient` instance to prefetch data server-side with `queryClient.prefetchQuery(...)`.
 *
 * 3. Dehydrates the fetched state with `dehydrate(queryClient)` and passes it to `<HydrationBoundary>`.
 *
 * 4. Renders the client-side `GamesGrid` component inside the hydration boundary.
 *    - `GamesGrid` consumes the prehydrated data using `useQuery` with the same `queryKey`.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This component is NOT marked with `"use client"`, so it runs exclusively on the server.
 * - This approach avoids redundant fetching on the client and enables instant display of content.
 * - Hydration relies on consistent `queryKey` usage between prefetch and client query.
